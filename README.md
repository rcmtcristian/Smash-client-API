## Lessons learned
How to undertand more DRY and implement methods to and extent 
With this application, I learned to create a REST API on the server using
Cors and Express. This application pushed to be more creative on how i organized
the character data so that it can be used in a versatile manner, such as when boding images to IDs.

## Tech

- Node.js
- Cors
- Express
- Html
- CSS
- Javascript
- Parallax 





## Node Dependencies
- Express
- Cors
## Optimizations

- Change top bar layout
- Modify search bar
- Optimise mobile responsiveness 
- Use browser developer tools that help to debug browser compatability tests
